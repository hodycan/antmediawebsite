				"We hired Two Stories Media to shoot a highlight film for an American Heart Association event and could not have been happier with the entire process of working with their team...We've already secured them for the following year's event because we could not have imagined the event without this footage to relive the moments!"

				We have worked with Two Stories Media on quite a few projects now and they are quickly moving to the top of our favorite vendors list. They are pleasant. their work is top shelf, and they always meet deadlines. Best of all, they offer suggestions on how to improve a project, starting with our original ideas and goals and making it better."
